# New system? Need your GPG key back?

I do!! I do!! I do!!!

## Usage

```bash
./setup.sh <public_key_file> <private_key_file>
```

This script will import your GPG keys from the files you provide. It will also set up your GPG configuration file to use the imported keys.
It also tells Git to use those keys for signing commits.
